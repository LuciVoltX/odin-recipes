# Odin Recipes

This project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The purpose of this project is to build a basic recipe website using HTML to practice fundamental web development skills.

## Project Overview

The **Odin Recipes** project is a static website that contains several recipe pages. The website consists of a main index page that links to individual recipe pages, each providing details about a specific recipe.

### Features:
- **Main Index Page**: A homepage with links to different recipes.
- **Recipe Pages**: Each recipe page contains:
  - A title of the recipe.
  - A list of ingredients.
  - Step-by-step cooking instructions.
  - An image (optional).

## Structure

The project follows a basic structure:

```
